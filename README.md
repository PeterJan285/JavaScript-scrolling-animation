## Welcome! 👋

- This time I practice making boxes of content sliding into the screen from both left and right to the centre using JS when scrolling down, and also disappear when scrolling up

### Languages and features 👨‍💻 

- JS: functions, IF statements, adding and removing classes.

Thanks for checking out my projects
